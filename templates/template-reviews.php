                            <p>If you need a website, you NEED the Computaid team.</p>
                            <p>The first time I met Suzanna Sahakian, I was impressed with her honesty, and her overwelming knowledge of her craft.
                                To give you some idea how much help I needed, when  she told me that not only would she create a wonderful website for me she
                                would also guarantee me top ranking, she had to explain to me what that meant.  Indeed days, literally, days after my website went live,
                                I was top ranked on Google. The Comptuaid Team  listened to what I wanted and integrated it with their awesome know how to make
                                the most wonderful website you've ever seen.  They spent hours and hours working on the design until it was just exactly what I wanted.
                                Suzanna had to teach me how to email her, foreward information, and numerous other things which had nothing to do whatever with designing a website,
                                but were so helpful to me.  I know in a testimonial you usually stick to the buisness aspects, but I want to say that Suzanna is one of the most sincere,
                                loving, supportive, giving people it has been my pleasure to do buisness with in a long time. Many people can do a job.
                                Suzanna gives you  her heart as well as her brain. I know you will be as pleased with the Computaid Team and Suzanna, and their web designs,
                                as I am. They are the BEST!  Check out the wonderful website they made for me at  lisasbabies.com and I know you'll want to work with them too.</p>

                                Suzanna is an expert in her field and a true professional. From the very first phone call she was
                                dedicated to making our website the best it could be and doing whatever was necessary to ensure maximum optimization.
                                She kept me informed and was constantly making sure that I was happy with every thing she did and would not stop until it was perfect.
                                She is a very intelligent and creative woman who is also filled with integrity and honor, it was truly a pleasure to work with her.

                            <p>Suzanna, Marina and Alexander are amazing -- totally professional, genuinely caring, and truly a gift.
                                They would not let me stop with "good enough" on my website, but kept working with me until I got something I absolutely love!
                                I have been delighted with the visits to my site and the terrific feedback from colleagues and clients. We did a second website together,
                                and now I'm working on another one. Suzanna, Marina and Alnexader really know their stuff!</p>

                            <p>This is to acknowledge the great job Suzanna did for me in developing a web site for me where people make prayer request.
                                This web site has been praised by all my friends and clients. The design , the wording and the efficiency is unimaginable.</p>

                            <p>It was tailored to meet the needs of all. Every priest who reads my web site wants the same developed for them.
                                We cannot stop saying thanks to Suzanna's foresight and her great skill in information technology.</p>
