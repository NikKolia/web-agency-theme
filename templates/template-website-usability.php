                    <h2>LESS IS OFTEN MORE</h2>

                    <p>Doesn’t it just make your day when you access a website that has the information or product
                        you’ve been searching for,
                        and you find what you need with the barest minimum of time, clicks, and fuss?</p>

                    <p>Well, it’s valuable to remember that feeling of relief when putting together your own website –
                        because your customers feel exactly the same way.</p>

                    <p>It’s natural to want to go for all the bells, whistles and windows to call attention to your site
                        (and web designers are more than happy to oblige – more money for them). But you have to
                        consider your client.</p>

                    <h2>MAKE YOUR WEBSITE EASY TO USE</h2>

                    <p>Maybe your visitor’s computer is out of date. Maybe they still have dial-up (yep, people still
                        do).
                        Maybe they only have a short time to find what they need online. Maybe they’re
                        techno-challenged.
                        Maybe pop-up widows really annoy them!</p>

                    <p>Part of attracting the right client for you is allowing for ALL the possibilities, and designing
                        your website to be as user-friendly as it can be. Quick downloads and easy access to every nook
                        and cranny of your site are vital.
                        Better yet, keep the nooks and crannies to a minimum.</p>

                    <h2>HELP YOUR CLIENTS FIND WHAT THEY NEED</h2>

                    <p>Website usability is one click away from website sales. Help people find their way through your
                        site and they’re more likely
                        to give you the result you desire – successful transactions.</p>
