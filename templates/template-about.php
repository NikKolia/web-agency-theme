                    <p>For a quarter of a century, COMPUTAID has served the computer and software development (and
                        recently the web design) needs of Los Angeles,
                        Santa Monica, California, and the world, while maintaining a positive, personal approach to

                    <p>Established in 1984 by Suzanna Sahakian, COMPUTAID began by computerizing offices, providing

                        and offering consulting and training services in Los Angeles, Santa Monica and London (UK).</p>

                        offering custom web design and web design by template at affordable prices, without compromising
                        quality – putting cutting edge websites
                        within anyone’s reach.</p>

                    <p>Our mission is to positively impact the community by keeping our clients ahead of the

                        We want to provide ideal solutions to businesses that really want worldwide Internet exposure,
                        but don’t want to spend a fortune.</p>
