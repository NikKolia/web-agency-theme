                    <h2>Local SEO is an effective way to market your business online.</h2>

                    <p>Local SEO is the optimization process for the local results in search engines. That means greater
                        visibility in
                        Google Maps and in the so called 7-pack </p>

                    <h2>Why is it important to be visible in Google Maps?</h2>

                    <p>It is important for your website to appear in Google Maps because you want people to be able to
                        find your contact details.
                        Perhaps people already know your business, but don’t know the phone number. If you set up your
                        website right, this location
                        data can easily be found through search engines.</p>

                    <p>More importantly, people often do not know your business yet and are searching globally for terms
                        like “pizza”,
                        “lawyer” or “broker in New York”. Google often shows a Google Map or a 7-pack for these kind of
                        searches, so it’s
                        of great importance that your business is listed there!</p>

                    <h2>What do I need to do?</h2>

                    <p>The first thing you have to do to get your website in Google Maps is to have a physical location
                        for your business.
                        That sounds silly, but this is one of the major requirements to get you listed in search
                        engines. It’s hard to rank on “divorce lawyer boston”
                        if your business isn’t physically located in Boston (even if you provide services there). After
                        you have a physical
                        location of your business you can sign up your business in the search engines: Google, Bing and
                        now evenApple.</p>

                    <p>The third thing you have to think of is your SEO strategy! Just like regular SEO, Local SEO
                        exists of both onpage and offpage SEO.
                        For onpage SEO it’s important you mention the address of your business on your website in
                        Schema.org format. And not only on your contact page,
                        but it’s also recommended to place it in the header or footer of your website, so it’s visible
                        on every page.</p>

                    <p>Besides the address itself the title tag is something you really need to look at. According to
                        the
                        Local Search Ranking Factors naming the City and State, besides your keyword, in your page title
                        is the most important thing to do.
                        A good format would be “
                        <your service>
                            <city>
                                <state>”, for example “Shiny Teeth dentist Portland Oregon”. It’s pretty straight
                                    forward,
                                    but clear and strong! But don’t take this format for granted. Play with it and, even
                                    better, test it!
                    </p>
