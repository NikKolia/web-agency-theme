                    <h2>Are You Search Engine Friendly?</h2>

                    <p>What if you gave a party, and nobody came? That’s the risk you run if your web design doesn’t
                        include Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
                        It’s like printing up invitations, then hiding them in a box in the back of the basement and
                        hoping your potential partygoers will find them.</p>

                    <p>The World Wide Web is too massive to leave the discovery of your website – your invitation to buy
                        your product or service – to chance.</p>
                    <p>You have to help your customers find you.</p>

                    <h2>The Great Search Engine Highway</h2>

                    <p>Your website is one place on earth you want a whole lot of traffic. And Search Engines – Google,
                        Ask.com,
                        Yahoo and the rest – are the major highways people travel to find their Internet
                        destinations.</p>

                    <p>Your Web Design has to help make that route as fast and direct as possible. Otherwise, your
                        website could be essentially
                        invisible to potential buyers searching the web for what you have to offer. Like any successful
                        business, you need good signage along the road.</p>

                    <h2>The Sooner They See You on Search Engines, The Better</h2>

                    <p>As your Web Design and Marketing Team, COMPUTAID keeps this in mind from the very beginning of

                        that draw Search Engine users to your specific service, we make it easy for your ideal potential
                        customers to find you.</p>

                        the Search Engines to penalize you,
                        like white on white text. We simply do everything possible within our web design and marketing
                        expertise to bring the right people to your party.</p>
