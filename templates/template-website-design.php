                    <h2>WEB DESIGN – IT SEEMS LIKE A SIMPLE CONCEPT</h2>

                    <p>Okay, so you’ve decided you want to promote your business on the web. You’ve decided you need
                        professional
                        help to make it happen. You’ve decided it’s time to choose someone to design and build your
                        website.
                        But what do you need that web designer to do to make your website successful?</p>

                    <h2>WEB DESIGN IS ONLY THE BEGINNING</h2>

                    <p>Just because a web designer can design and build a pretty website doesn’t mean they are
                        the right web designer for you. Yes, they may have the technical training and expertise to get
                        and keep your website online.
                        They may have the graphics skills and creative spark to make your site a beauty to behold.</p>

                    <p>But that doesn’t mean they have the marketing, sales, or search engine know-how necessary to
                        bring customers to you - and entice them to buy.</p>

                    <h2>YOUR WEBSITE HAS TO BE MORE THAN JUST A PRETTY FACE</h2>

                    <p>Not all web designers have the skill to sell as well as design. It makes sense, because not all
                        websites are designed to sell.
                        And not many web design courses of study include marketing or search engine optimization (SEO)
                        in their curriculums.</p>

                    <p>Most web design companies do have a specialty, whether graphic, sales, or SEO.
                        But finding one that has truly mastered all the elements is a tricky proposition.
                        As a busy businessperson, do you have the time to learn all the things you need to know to make
                        that determination?</p>
